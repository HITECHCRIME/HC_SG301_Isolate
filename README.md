## Lyrics

```
oh noo nooo

isolate your fears inna jail of the mind 
i'm insane, inmate of my dread, feeling just fine

make it sane, my belief is in vain
make it sane, my belief is in vain
in the past what was done was the pain
of it all it would last audible
took a single approach 
on a vicious reproach ey

i've been jaded asset no pain's enough 
it's not pain to all my friends
all thought i'm nuts, not doing right
i got turned for the bright of nights eyyy

let's do it

all my favourite times my friends were done
i paid the price, it was fair
shame is lies, i made it far
i'm sure i need no break yeah
i wanna play
i wanna play
i've been a phase
i've been away 
i've been away yeah


```
