## Lyrics

```
oh noo nooo

isolate your fears inna jail of the mind 
i'm insane, inmate of my dread, feeling just fine
make it sane, my belief is in vain
make it sane my belief is in vain
in the past what was done was the pain
of it all it would last 
took a single approach 
on a vicious reproach ey





```
